I am Ineva – a thoughtful soul with a love for words, silence, and writing.
I enjoy turning thoughts into texts, capturing emotions in language, and making small things meaningful.
Not to impress, but to touch.

Since 2019, I’ve enjoyed playing Luanti, constantly diving into new creative projects. On GitHub, I’m here to learn new things – currently Lua – and to creatively play with systems, whether in code or expression.
